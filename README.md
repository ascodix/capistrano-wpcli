### Available commands

$ wpcli:set_permissions    # Set 666 permission for `.htaccess` and 777 for `uploads` on remote environment
$ wpcli:db:push            # Override the remote environment's database with your local copy. Will also do a 'search and replace' for the site URLs.
$ wpcli:db:pull            # Override the local database with your remote environment's copy. Will also do a 'search and replace' for the site URLs.
$ wpcli:db:backup          # Take an sqldump of the remote environment's database and store it in a folder of your local repository called db_backups (its ignored in Git)
```

```
cap production wpcli:db:push
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
